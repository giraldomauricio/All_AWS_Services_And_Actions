# All AWS Services and Actions

Author: Mauricio Giraldo <mgiraldo@gmail.com>

This repo contains all the AWS Services and it's possible action to the date of the last commit.

I created this project as a need to create an even bigger project involving IAM. But when I saw how
many people are asking for this, I decided to put part of my project public.

I use the APIs behind the Policy Simulator to obtain the data, so if AWS keeps it up to date, this list will be as well.

# Requirements

1. Technically nothing, but if you want to run the shell command by yourself, you will need an AWS account. A free-tier one is fine.
