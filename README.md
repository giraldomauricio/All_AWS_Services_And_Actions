# All AWS Services and Actions

This repo contains all the AWS Services, and every possible action to the date of the last commit.

I created this project as a need to create an even bigger project involving IAM. But when I saw how
many people are asking for this, I decided to put part of my project public.

I use the APIs behind the Policy Simulator to obtain the data, so if AWS keeps it up to date, this list will be as well.

Remember that these services are categorized the way AWS sees them in hierarchy. For example: you will find VPC under EC2,
and not as an independent JSON.
